I've included the first project in data analytics that I completed after finishing the course.

# Predict-Student-Performance-in-High-school-Data-Mining-

Abstract: Predict student performance in secondary education (high school).

Data Set Information:

This data looks at secondary school student achievement in two Portuguese schools. The data elements include student grades, demographic, social, and school-related characteristics, and it was gathered through the use of school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets on performance in two independent courses are provided: mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). [Cortez and Silva, 2008] modelled the two datasets using binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. It is important to notice that the target attribute G3 has a high association with the traits G2 and G1. This is because G3 is the final year grade (given in the third period), whereas G1 and G2 are the first and second period marks. It is more harder to forecast G3 in the absence of G2 and G1, yet such prediction is far more accurate.
